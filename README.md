## Let me learn Elm (programming language)

"Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice",[[6]](https://elm-lang.org/) made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language))
